        This is Jack. He's an odd little boy that just got an empty box for his birthday. He may look happy, but he's
        disappointed. Now he'll have to put a few <br>
        things in the box.
    </p>
    <p>
        Jack would really like...
    <ul>
        <li>Roller blades</li>
        <li>Magic tricks</li>
        <li>Anything Pkemin</li>
        <li>A motorized Lego set</li>
    </ul>
    You can get all this (and more) at an online toy store. Two very popular ones are <a href="#">toysrus.com</a> and
    <a href="#">eToys</a>.
